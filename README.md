# E-commerce-Customer-Behavior-Analysis-Mobile-App-vs.-Website-Engagement

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior data for an Ecommerce company based in New York City. The company, which sells clothing both online and through in-store style advice sessions, seeks to optimize its business strategy by understanding whether customers prefer shopping via their mobile app or website.

Using Linear Regression techniques, this project aims to provide insights into which platform the company should prioritize to enhance customer experience and drive sales.

**Project Goals**

- **Analyze customer data:** Understand the key factors influencing customer purchases on both the mobile app and website.

- **Model development:** Build a Linear Regression model to predict customer behavior based on different variables.

- **Decision-making insights:** Provide actionable recommendations on whether the company should focus more on the mobile app or the website.

**About the Dataset**

The dataset contains details of customers from a New York-based Ecommerce company that sells clothing online and offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers can meet with a personal stylist in-store, and then make purchases through the mobile app or website.

The company's goal is to determine whether they should focus more on enhancing their mobile app experience or their website. Our task is to analyze the data and provide insights to help them make this decision.

**Note:** The dataset is only for testing skills and does not resemble any real-world entities.

**Dataset Features**

- **Customer Info:** Includes details such as Email, Address, and color Avatar.

- **Avg. Session Length:** Average duration of in-store style advice sessions.

- **Time on App:** Average time spent on the mobile app in minutes.

- **Time on Website:** Average time spent on the website in minutes.

- **Length of Membership:** The number of years the customer has been a member.

**Tools and Technologies**

- Python: For data processing and model development.

- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.

- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.

**Steps Involved**

- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and data type conversions.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data trends, correlations, and patterns.

- **Feature Engineering:** Create and select relevant features for the model.

- **Modeling:** Develop and fine-tune the Linear Regression model.

- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.

- **Recommendations:** Provide insights and recommendations based on the model's findings.

**Results**

The final model helped identify key drivers of customer behavior on both the mobile app and the website. The analysis revealed that company should either further develop its website to match the performance of the app or else it can focus on the app which is doing better for the company.
